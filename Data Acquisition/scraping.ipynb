Currently, hundreds of thousands of blogs, forums, product review sites, and e-commerce merchants currently exist, in part, to service consumer's need to access product related information and demand to share experiences with products. The goal of this competition is to determine the state-of-the-art methods to automatically recognize product mentions in such textual content and to also disambiguate which product(s) in product catalogs are being referenced. Specifically, the task is to automatically identify all mentions of consumer products in a largely user generated collection of web-content, and to correctly identify the product(s) that each product mention refers to from a large catalog of products. The datasets provided includes hundreds of thousands of text items, a product catalog with over fifteen million products, and hundreds of manually annotated product mentions to support data-driven approaches. The prize pool for the contest is $10,000 and is divided as follows: $6,000 for first, $3,000 for second and $1,000 for third place submissions. Note that the contest is colocated with the ICDM-2012 conference. There will be a workshop on the contest results on December 10th.\", 'dataset_text': 'The CPROD1 competition involves the release of six data files to contestants. Five of the files are provided immediately, while the model evalulation set of text items will be released later to determine the contest winners. Files are in two formats: JSON format and .CSV format The six files are as follows: Sample Perl Code is provided in the file CPROD1_baseline.120707.pl, which also produces a simple benchmark. The files to be used for model training have been bundled together in TrainingSet.zip/.7z: products.json, training-annotated-text.json, training-disambiguated-text.json, training-non-annotated-text.json. The file PublicLeaderboardSet.zip/.7z contains leaderboard-text.json for determining the leaderboard rankings. Below we describe the key data entities involved (text items, products, and disambiguated product mentions), along with the process used to generate the data. For the contest, a “text item” stands for a tokenized representation of a portion or entirety of a web page or a web-forum postings page. We processed each web item to create text items as follows: Here is an example of a text_item: \"TextItem\": {\"0c1edc5b2ed5abb25e25b966ccdb01d2\": [\"Here\",\"\\'s\",\"an\",\"example\",\"of\",\"a\",\"(\",\"pre-tokenized\",\")\",\"text”, “item\",\".\",\"\", \" \", \"Check\",\"out\",\"the\",\"new\",\"iPhone\",\"4s\",\"!\"]}  Notice: 1) how the word \"Here\\'s\" has been divided into two tokens: \"Here\" and \"’s\"; 2) how the end-of-sentence punctuation have been placed into their own tokens; and 3) how sentences have been seperated by both a \"” token representing an end-of-sentence and a \" \" token representing an end of paragraph. For the contest a “product item” is a semi-structured record that represents some purchasable consumer product from either the consumer electronics (CE) or automotive (AU) verticals. Each record has: 1) a unique string-based identifier, and 2) an array composed of a string-based “name”, a two character-based product category, and a two digit-based price.  A sample of some of the products records is presented below (in tabular format): {\"1QlV3Pe6T0W\":[\"iphone 3\",\"CE\",399.95],\"op6rsUEYjWc\":[\"ifone case\",\"CE\",21.25],\"P7Ntsvaer1Y\":[\"hawk break pads for SUVs\",\"AU\",110.00]}   For the contest a disambiguated product mention is a structured record composed of two fields: a product mention identifier, and a space-separated set of product item identifiers. The identiffier represents some specific product mention within some specific text item, for example: 0c1edc5b2ed5abb25e25b966ccdb01d2:0-2 represents the product mention that begins on the first token and ends on the third token in textitem 0c1edc5b2ed5abb25e25b966ccdb01d2. (product mentions are always complete substrings of one or more tokens). Finally, the set of space-separated product identifiers represents the products within the product catalog that have been deemed to refer to the same product as the mention.   We used the following process to annotate text items. The annotation task involved two phases: 1) the identification of product mention\\nwithin text items, and 2) the labeling of product records for each annotated product mention with True match (or False match). During the first phase a set of text items were randomly selected. Each text item was reviewed by at least two different annotators. In cases where there was disagreement about mentions a third annotator broke ties. During the second phase the human annotators were asked to classify which products were legitimate references for each of the product mentions. This phase was significantly more time consuming so only a small portion of product candidates were reviewed by two or more annotators.   We randomly separated the annotated text items into training set, leaderboard set and model evaluation set using 50%, 25% and 25% proportions.'}\n",

Practice Fusion is now sponsoring the second and final phase of the challenge inspired by the winning problem: Identify patients diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Over 25 million people, or nearly 8.3% of the entire United States population, have diabetes. Diabetes is also associated with a wide range of complications from heart disease and stroke to blindness and kidney disease. Predicting who has diabetes will lead to a better understanding of these complications and the common comorbidities that diabetics suffer. The Challenge: Given a de-identified data set of patient electronic health records, build a model to determine who has a diabetes diagnosis, as defined by ICD9 codes 250, 250.0, 250.*0 or 250.*2 (e.g., 250, 250.0, 250.00, 250.10, 250.52, etc).\", 'dataset_text': \"Update: this dataset has been removed at the request of the host.

      "{'name': 'Cause-effect pairs', 'url': 'https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cause-effect-pairs', 'overview_text': 'Overview text not found', 'description_text': 'Come to our NIPS workshop (dec 9 or 10 in Tahoe).                                The problem of attributing causes to effects is pervasive in science, medicine, economy and almost every aspects of our everyday life involving human reasoning and decision making. What affects your health? the economy? climate changes? The gold standard to establish causal relationships is to perform randomized controlled experiments. However, experiments are costly while non-experimental \"observational\" data collected routinely around the world are readily available. Unraveling potential cause-effect relationships from such observational data could save a lot of time and effort. Consider for instance a target variable B, like occurence of \"lung cancer\" in patients. The goal would be to find whether a factor A, like \"smoking\", might cause B. The objective of the challenge is to rank pairs of variables {A, B} to prioritize experimental verifications of the conjecture that A causes B. As is known, \"correlation does not mean causation\". More generally, observing a statistical dependency between A and B does not imply that A causes B or that B causes A;  A and B could be consequences of a common cause. But, is it possible to determine from the joint observation of samples of two variables A and B that A should be a cause of B? There are new algorithms that have appeared in the literature in the past few years that tackle this problem. This challenge is an opportunity to evaluate them and propose new techniques to improve on them. We provide hundreds of pairs of real variables with known causal relationships from domains as diverse as chemistry, climatology, ecology, economy, engineering, epidemiology, genomics, medicine, physics. and sociology. Those are intermixed with controls (pairs of independent variables and pairs of variables that are dependent but not causally related) and semi-artificial cause-effect pairs (real variables mixed in various ways to produce a given outcome). This challenge is limited to pairs of variables deprived of their context. Thus constraint-based methods relying on conditional independence tests and/or graphical models are not applicable. The goal is to push the state-of-the art in complementary methods, which can eventually disambiguate Markov equivalence classes. If you are skeptical that this is possible, try this quiz: Examine the plot below of values of variable B plotted as a function of values of variable A. Can you guess which one is a cause of the other? Hint: Some non-linear functions are non-invertible.
